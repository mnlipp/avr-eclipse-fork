================================================================================
Version 2.3.4

This release fixes the long standing issues with running on 64bit Windows. Also
XMegas are now fully supported (at least as far as WinAVR supports them)

================================================================================
Version 2.3.3

This release fixes a single bug that caused failures with "makefile" AVR-GCC Projects.

================================================================================
Version 2.3.2

This release fixes some bugs and minor issues. See Changelog.txt for details.

================================================================================
Version 2.3.1

This is a major release with some new features

1. What's new

	* Support for Fuses / LockBits files
		- Two new wizards to create fuse and lockbit files (New -> Other -> AVR -> ....)
		- An editor to edit these files.
		- The files can be selected as the fuses / lockbits source on the AVRDude property
		  Fuses / Lockbits pages.

	* Detailed preview of the selected fuse bytes on the project 
	  AVRDude property Fuses / Lockbits pages. 

	* Some improvements "under the hood" and some bugfixes. See the changelog for details.

2. Information

2.1. System Requirements

   AVR Eclipse requires JRE 1.5 or higher and supports following versions of CDT:
    * CDT 5.0.x (Eclipse 3.4 [Ganymede])
    * CDT 6.0.x (Eclipse 3.5 [Galileo])
    * CDT 7.0.x (Eclipse 3.6 [Helios])
    
    Note: The AVR Eclipse Plugin might work with CDT 4.0.x (Eclipse 3.3 [Europa]), but this
    hasn't been tested for quite some time.
   
   older versions of the JRE or of Eclipse / CDT are not supported.
   
   It has been tested with
   	- Windows XP + winAVR 20081124rc3 / 20080610
   	- Linux X86 (Ubuntu 7.10 + Ubuntu supplied avr-gcc / custom build avr-gcc)
   	
   	- avrdude support has been tested against avrdude 5.5. Older version are untested.
   	
   	It should run on all platforms meeting the system requirements.

2.2 Known issues

	* When changing the MCU Type of a project, Eclipse will add the discovered symbols of
	  the new MCU to the list of "build-in" symbols, but still keeps the symbols of the 
	  previous MCU Types (Eclipse currently never forgets any discovered symbols).
	  The same goes for discovered include paths in case the toolchain is changed.
	  
================================================================================
Version 2.2.0 release date: 18 June 2008

This is a major release with some new features.

1. What's new

	* Support for avrdude.
	  The plugin now supports avrdude to upload projects to a target device.
	  See the "Upload a project..." tutorial in the Getting Started section of the user 
	  documentation on how to use avrdude to upload projects.
	  
	* New "AVR Supported MCUs" View
	  A new view has been added to show all target MCUs supported by the plugin and the external
	  tools used by the plugin.
	  The view can be open via Window > Show View > Other... > AVR > AVR Supported MCUs
	  
	* AVR target hardware properties (and avrdude properties) can now be set for each build
	  configuration (like in 2.0, but unlike 2.1)
	  
	* Some improvements "under the hood" and some bugfixes. See the changelog for details.



================================================================================
Version 2.1.1 release date: 25 March 2008

This release fixes two bugs. See the Changelog.txt for details.

================================================================================
Version 2.1.0 release date: 10 February 2008

This is an intermediate release with both bug fixes and new features.

This release is not compatible with the 2.0 versions. To update projects created
with a 2.0.x version, a project converter is available.
To execute the converter right click on your project and select the "Convert To..."
item.

Avrdude - one of the most requested features - is still not supported, but there
is already some framework code in place for the integration of avrdude in the next
release.

1. What's new

	* C/C++ Support
	  Just create a new "C++ Project" and select one of the "AVR Cross Target" items.

	* Preference Page to manage the paths to the avr-gcc toolchain
	  Use this if you have problems with the correct paths. The plugin still tries to
	  determine the paths to the avr-gcc toolchain and some other files itself, but 
	  the discovered paths can now be manually adjusted.

	* The MCU type setting is now a project property setting
	  Right click on an AVR Project and select the AVR Target Hardware item to set the 
	  MCU Type and Frequency.
	  Note: per configuration selection of the MCU / F_CPU will come back in one of the 
	  next versions, but implemented differently than in the 2.0 version.

	* A dedicated "Discovery Profile".
	  On the project properties go to C/C++ Build --> Discovery Options and select
	  "AVRGCCManagedMakePerProjectProfileC" or "AVRGCCManagedMakePerProjectProfileCPP".
	  Then Eclipse will automatically determine the path to the system header filer (e.g. <avr/io.h>)
	  This is very useful as now an F3 on any #include <....> will open the file. Also the source 
	  editor will color #ifdef (__AVR_yourMCUtype__) sections correctly (see known issues below).

	* Additional Options for the Compiler.
	  A few options have been added that are also the default on mfile generated makefiles.

	* Dependencies for the Compiler (and Assembler) work now, so any changes to a header file
	  will cause all dependent source files to be rebuild.

	* List of supported MCUs determined at runtime.
	  Now the plugin is always in sync with your avr-gcc / winAVR version.

	* Numerous improvements "under the hood" and some bugfixes. See the changelog for details.
