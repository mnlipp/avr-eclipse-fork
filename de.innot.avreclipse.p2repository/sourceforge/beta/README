This folder contains beta releases of the AVR Eclipse Plugin.

Beta releases have not yet been tested in depth. They should work, but they may still contain some bugs.
If you like to try a beta release it is recommended to use an Eclipse installation separate from your 
production Eclipse installation. The same goes for your Workspace. Create a new Workspace and import any
existing AVR projects into this new workspace. At least make a backup of your projects before using
a beta release of the AVR Eclipse Plugin.
